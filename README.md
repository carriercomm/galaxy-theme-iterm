This is a color theme for iTerm that I made based on some beautiful code snippets on the [Marionette JS](http://marionettejs.com/) website a while back.

## Installing

1. Clone the repo locally (or simply download the [galaxy-theme.itermcolors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jglovier/galaxy-theme-iterm/master/galaxy-theme.itermcolors) raw file locally)
2. In iTerm, go to **iTerm** > **Preferences** > **Profiles** > **Colors** (tab) > **Load Presets** (dropdown) > **Import**
3. Set as default for new shell windows by going to **Other Actions...** (with the gear icon) and choose **Set as Default**
